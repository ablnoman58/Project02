      <b>I am writing to you with a heavy heart</b> to request your kind <mark>assistance</mark> in obtaining a waiver <strong>for the upcoming semester's tuition fee.</strong> My father is a hardworking teacher, and his monthly income is approximately 30,000 TK. Unfortunately, due to the size of my family, which<del> consists </del>of six members, and various financial obligations, we are facing significant financial difficulties. As the eldest son, I feel responsible for easing the burden on my family, <u>but the</u> financial strain has made it <em>impossible </em>for them to <br><I>support my</I> education financially.</p>
